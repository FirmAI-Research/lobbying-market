# To Do (for project completion)
* Complete modelling and collect results

* Complete all assignments (reports) 
    - Data gathering and defining stakeholders + KPIs (I made a bullet-point version in the `notes` directory)
    - Data analysis and visualizations 
    - Modelling proposal
    - List of success and pitfalls of modelling approach (with visualizations and metrics)

* Organize the GitHub with the following directory structure
    - `data`: Contains final versions of the data
    - `data_processing`: Contains data that is used for processing
    - `notebooks`: Contains important results (visualizations, statistics, modelling, etc.)
    - `notes`: Contains reports and meeting notes
    - `junk`: Contains old or irrelevant files (may be deleted before submission)
    - `utils`: Contains useful modules or files  

    The only file in the main page should be the slides.

* (Optional) Make a README file that summarizes the project and results well

* Make slides and make a video recording of presentation
